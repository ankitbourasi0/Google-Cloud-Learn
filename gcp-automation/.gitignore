# Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sensitive data.
# These should not be part of version control as they are data points which are
# potentially sensitive and subject to change per environment.
#
# Example:
# terraform.tfvars
# terraform.tfvars.json
*.tfvars
*.tfvars.json

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally
# and so are not checked in
#
# Example:
# override.tf
# override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# Ignore CLI configuration files
.terraformrc
terraform.rc

# Optional: ignore plan files saved before applying Terraform configuration
# Uncomment the line below if you want to ignore planout files.
# example: *tfplan*
